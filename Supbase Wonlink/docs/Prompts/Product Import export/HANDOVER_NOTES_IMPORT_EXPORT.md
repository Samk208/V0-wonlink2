## 🔧 TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

### File Processing Flow
```
1. User uploads file → /api/import-export/upload
2. File stored in Supabase Storage (imports bucket)
3. File record created in file_uploads table
4. User triggers processing → /api/import-export/process
5. File downloaded and parsed (CSV/Excel/JSON)
6. Data validated with Zod schemas
7. Batch processing (100 records per batch)
8. Products inserted via bulk_insert_products()
9. Progress updated in real-time
10. Errors logged in import_errors table
```

### Export Flow
```
1. User requests export → /api/import-export/export
2. Data queried from database (products/campaigns/analytics)
3. File generated (CSV/Excel/JSON)
4. File uploaded to Supabase Storage (exports bucket)
5. Temporary download URL created
6. Export job status updated
```

### Security Model
- **Authentication**: All endpoints require user auth
- **Authorization**: RLS policies enforce user isolation
- **File Access**: Private buckets with temporary URLs
- **Data Isolation**: Users only access their own data

## ⚠️ CRITICAL MUST-DOS FOR LLM ASSISTANTS

### 1. BEFORE MAKING ANY CHANGES

```bash
# ALWAYS check these files first:
- docs/IMPORT_EXPORT_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md
- scripts/products-and-import-export-schema.sql
- docs/SUPABASE_STORAGE_SETUP.md
```

### 2. DATABASE REQUIREMENTS

**🚨 CRITICAL**: The database schema MUST be applied first:
```sql
-- Run this in Supabase SQL Editor:
scripts/products-and-import-export-schema.sql
```

**Check points**:
- [ ] Products table exists
- [ ] File_uploads, import_errors, export_jobs tables exist
- [ ] RLS policies are active
- [ ] PostgreSQL functions are created

### 3. STORAGE REQUIREMENTS

**🚨 CRITICAL**: Supabase storage buckets MUST be configured:
- [ ] 'imports' bucket created (private)
- [ ] 'exports' bucket created (private)
- [ ] RLS policies configured for both buckets
- [ ] User folder structure implemented

**Follow**: `docs/SUPABASE_STORAGE_SETUP.md` exactly

### 4. DEPENDENCY REQUIREMENTS

**🚨 CRITICAL**: These packages are REQUIRED:
```json
{
  "papaparse": "^5.5.3",
  "@types/papaparse": "^5.3.16",
  "xlsx": "^0.18.5",
  "react-dropzone": "^14.3.8",
  "zod": "^3.24.1"
}
```

### 5. ENVIRONMENT CHECKS

**Before debugging issues**:
```bash
# Check these files exist and are correct:
✅ /app/api/import-export/upload/route.ts
✅ /app/api/import-export/process/route.ts
✅ /app/api/import-export/export/route.ts
✅ /app/api/import-export/templates/route.ts
✅ /app/api/import-export/status/route.ts
✅ /app/import-export/page.tsx
✅ /components/import-export/file-upload-zone.tsx
```

## 🐛 COMMON ISSUES & SOLUTIONS

### Issue 1: "Upload Failed" Error
**Cause**: Storage buckets not configured
**Solution**: Follow `docs/SUPABASE_STORAGE_SETUP.md`

### Issue 2: "Database Error" During Processing
**Cause**: Schema not applied or products table missing
**Solution**: Run `scripts/products-and-import-export-schema.sql`

### Issue 3: "Authentication Error"
**Cause**: User not logged in or session expired
**Solution**: Check auth middleware, ensure user authentication

### Issue 4: "File Not Found" During Download
**Cause**: Export file not generated or expired URL
**Solution**: Check export_jobs table, regenerate if needed

### Issue 5: Translation Keys Missing
**Cause**: New keys not added to translations
**Solution**: Add keys to `lib/translations.ts` for all languages

---

## 🔄 MAINTENANCE GUIDELINES

### For Bug Fixes
1. **Identify the component**: Frontend, API, Database, or Storage
2. **Check logs**: Browser console, Supabase logs, API responses
3. **Verify setup**: Database schema, storage buckets, dependencies
4. **Test thoroughly**: Import and export flows after fixes

### For Feature Additions
1. **Understand current flow**: Read implementation summary first
2. **Follow existing patterns**: Use same structure as current APIs
3. **Update all layers**: Database, API, Frontend, Translations
4. **Test edge cases**: Large files, network errors, auth issues

### For Performance Issues
1. **Check batch sizes**: Currently 100 records per batch
2. **Monitor database**: Use Supabase performance insights
3. **Profile file processing**: Large files may need optimization
4. **Review memory usage**: Ensure proper cleanup

## 📞 SUPPORT ESCALATION

### When to Escalate
1. **Database corruption**: Products table data loss
2. **Security breach**: Unauthorized file access
3. **Performance degradation**: Processing takes >5 minutes
4. **Data loss**: Import/export files disappearing
5. **Authentication failures**: Users can't access system

### Debug Information to Collect
1. **User ID**: Which user experienced the issue
2. **File details**: Size, format, content sample
3. **Error messages**: Exact text from UI and console
4. **Database state**: file_uploads, import_errors table data
5. **Storage state**: Bucket contents and permissions

---

## 🎯 SUCCESS METRICS

The system is working correctly if:
- ✅ 95%+ of valid files process successfully
- ✅ Processing time <2 minutes for 10,000 records
- ✅ Export generation <5 seconds
- ✅ Error rate <1% for properly formatted files
- ✅ Zero security incidents (file access violations)
- ✅ 100% uptime during business hours

---

## 🔮 FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS (Optional)

### Potential Improvements
1. **Advanced column mapping**: Visual drag-drop interface
2. **Scheduled exports**: Automated periodic exports
3. **Import validation preview**: Show data before processing
4. **File compression**: Support for ZIP uploads
5. **API rate limiting**: Advanced throttling
6. **Audit trails**: Detailed operation logging

### Implementation Notes
- These are NOT required for current functionality
- Current system is complete and production-ready
- Only implement if specifically requested by user
