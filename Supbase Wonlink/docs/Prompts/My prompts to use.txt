CRITICAL ISSUE: SSR hydration mismatch causing "Text content did not match" warnings in React 19

PROBLEM DETAILS:
- Server renders with default language "en" 
- Client immediately switches to localStorage language (ko/zh)
- Causes DOM mismatch between server and client renders
- Custom i18n system in lib/translations.ts with useTranslation() hook
- Language state managed in app/providers.tsx with React Context
- Affects onboarding flows and language switching

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Fix hydration mismatch using cookie-based language detection
2. Maintain existing useTranslation() hook API
3. Keep current translation keys and structure intact
4. Ensure SSR-safe language persistence
5. Support 3 languages: English (en), Korean (ko), Chinese (zh)

IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY:
- Replace localStorage with cookies for server-side access
- Use Next.js cookies() API for server-side language detection  
- Implement useEffect pattern for client-side language sync
- Add hydration boundary components where needed
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing components

FILES TO MODIFY:
- app/providers.tsx (language context provider)
- lib/translations.ts (translation hook)
- middleware.ts (create new - language detection)
- components/language-selector.tsx (update cookie handling)

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Use Next.js 15 App Router patterns
- Implement proper TypeScript types
- Follow existing code style and conventions
- Add error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Ensure mobile compatibility (Capacitor app ready)

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- Zero hydration mismatch warnings in console
- Language switching works without page refresh
- Server-rendered HTML matches client-rendered HTML
- All existing translation functionality preserved
- Performance impact minimal (<50ms)

REFERENCE IMPLEMENTATIONS:
- Use cookie pattern from carlogino.com tutorial
- Follow useEffect hydration patterns from LogRocket blog
- Implement NextResponse cookie setting for middleware

ADDITIONAL CONTEXT:
- Platform has 100+ translation keys across EN/KO/ZH
- Used by Korean market primarily
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Integration with Supabase authentication required

Fix hydration mismatch in Wonlink language selector and provider components.

CURRENT ISSUE: Server renders "en" default but client switches to localStorage language causing hydration errors.

TASK: Update these React components to use cookie-based language detection:
- components/language-selector.tsx 
- Any components using useTranslation() hook that cause hydration issues

REQUIREMENTS:
- Replace localStorage access with cookie reading/writing
- Add useEffect hook to prevent hydration mismatch
- Maintain existing UI/UX (dropdown with flags: üá∫üá∏ English, üá∞üá∑ ÌïúÍµ≠Ïñ¥, üá®üá≥ ‰∏≠Êñá)
- Keep Radix UI components and Tailwind styling
- Ensure mobile-responsive design

PATTERN TO FOLLOW:
```javascript
const [mounted, setMounted] = useState(false);
useEffect(() => setMounted(true), []);
if (!mounted) return <LoadingState />;
```

TEST: Language switching should work without page refresh and no console warnings.

     ‚òê Configure Supabase storage bucket for imports
     ‚òê Build export generation and download functionality

‚óè Now I need to create instructions for setting up the Supabase

     # Supabase Storage Setup for Import/Export Functionality
     This guide explains how to set up the required storage buckets    
      for the import/export functionality in the Wonlink platform.     
     ## Required Storage Buckets
     The import/export system requires two storage buckets:
     1. **imports** - For storing uploaded files during import
     process
     2. **exports** - For storing generated export files
